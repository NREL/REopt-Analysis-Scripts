# REopt Analysis Scripts for the REopt API and Julia Package

[REopt](https://reopt.nrel.gov/) is a techno-economic decision support model
from NREL which is used for optimizing energy systems for buildings, campuses,
communities, and microgrids. REopt can be accessed in many ways: 
- Free, easy to use web tool: https://reopt.nrel.gov/
- By calling the REopt application programming interface (API) (examples in this repository)
- By using the registered REopt Julia Package (examples in this repository)
  
This repository includes useful guidance and example scripts for using REopt's API and Julia package. Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/NREL/REopt-Analysis-Scripts/wiki) for additional information and setup steps. 

[Open a cloud-hosted Jupyter Notebook to interface with the API using Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NREL/REopt-Analysis-Scripts/blob/master/REopt%20API%20Scripts/google_colab_simple_examples.ipynb)

If you instead wish to develop and use these codebases locally, see instructions [here](https://github.com/NREL/REopt_API/blob/master/README.md).

**Note:** As of May 2024, the REopt API has decommissioned (end-of-life) v1 and v2 of the API, and the /stable URL is equivalent to v3 which is the only public version of the API. V3 of the API calls the REopt.jl Julia package internally.
