# REopt Analysis Scripts for the REopt API and Julia Package

[REopt](https://reopt.nrel.gov/) is a techno-economic decision support model
from NREL which is used for optimizing energy systems for buildings, campuses,
communities, and microgrids. REopt can be accessed in many ways: 
- Free, easy to use web tool: https://reopt.nrel.gov/
- By calling the REopt application programming interface (API) (examples in this repository)
- By using the registered REopt Julia Package (examples in this repository)
  
This repository includes useful guidance and example scripts for using REopt's API and Julia package. Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/NREL/REopt-Analysis-Scripts/wiki) for additional information and setup steps. 

If you instead wish to develop and use these codebases locally, see instructions [here](https://github.com/NREL/REopt_API/blob/master/README.md).

**Note:** In September 2023, the REopt API is transitioning from "V2" to "V3". This will entail major changes to the format of POSTS and returend results from the API. Please see the wiki for more information.
